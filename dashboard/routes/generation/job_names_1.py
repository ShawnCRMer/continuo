# workflow and no model title is written here:
#   runs on   the generation registry's provider display label for the target (comfyui-local -> "Local");
#   workflow  the registry's target label ("MiniMax H3 · Frames"), else the model catalog's family + variant label

# Read once per process (both catalogs are static files); Hermes' continuo_jobs_list reads the same field.

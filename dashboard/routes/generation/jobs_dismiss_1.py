# --- Dismissed failures (lane p5c-frm item 1; frame charter decision 3, added 28.10.) ------------------------
# A failed job stays in the Jobs list until the artist dismisses it (Dismiss per row, "Clear failed"; the
# Premiere/Resolve render queue "Clear"). Hermes has the same verb (continuo_jobs_dismiss) on the same route
# with the same refusals. The ids live in one small JSON per owner scope under the Hermes state root
# (append-only, atomic replace, bounded to the newest _JOBS_DISMISSED_MAX). /jobs/list marks each row
# ``dismissed``, leaves them out unless include_dismissed, and its ``counts`` never count them. Only failed rows of the scope's own list
# can be dismissed: a running or waiting one is refused job_running, an id the scope does not list job_not_found.

_JOBS_DISMISSED_MAX = 500
# lane p7-jobs (VID-102): failed and cancelled rows are cleared alike; only failed ones are counted.

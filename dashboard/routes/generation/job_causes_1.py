# --- Why a Video job failed (lane w11-backend item 3, M-35 backend half) -----------------------------
#
# The Shoot ledger keeps a finite reason_code per row; the sentence the artist was shown ("Choose an output
# folder for this project", "keyframe is outside approved roots") was lost, and a submit refused before a
# ledger row existed left no job at all, so the Jobs list showed only Image jobs. One small private SQLite
# table under the Hermes state folder keeps (a) the cause of a failed ledger row by its job id and (b) every
# refused submit as a job of its project (raw_state "refused"), beside the Shoot ledger. /jobs/list answers both. Causes are the
# finite route sentences; a text that looks like a path is never stored. Notes never fail a route.

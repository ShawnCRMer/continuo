"""Calibrated thresholds for honest tempo / meter status (lane fs-beat, 2026-10-20).

Every constant carries the measurement it was chosen from.  Raw rows, scripts and the
full write-up: ``film-suite-fanout/out/fs-beat/DECODER.md`` (scratch ``fs/beat``:
``calib.py``, ``meter.py``, ``ours_calib.py``, ``tempo_status_rows.json``,
``meter_status_rows.json``, ``ours_calib.jsonl``).  Change a value only with a new
measurement on held-out data, and update the numbers here in the same commit.
